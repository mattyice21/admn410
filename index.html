				<p>	We at Durham House of Pets would like to welcome all of you to our new website where you can find everything you are looking for about our store.  We are proud to announce that we have recently opened our doors and established ourselves as the prime pet store in the Durham-UNH area!  We welcome one and all to our store and our website.  A brief history on us is that our family, the James family, have lived in the Durham area all our lives and we generated a special bond with our pets and our neighbors pets.  Our love for these animals has pushed our family to open this pet store and bring more life to this beautiful town! For information about where to find us and how to contact us, click on the "Contact Us" section above.
